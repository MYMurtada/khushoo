# khushoo

Hello, let me introduce my first ever fully functional application KHOSHOO.
The app is implemented using flutter framwork and dart language.

The application supports both english and arabic language.



WHAT IS IT ABOUT?
The application main funconality is to view the prayer times in a modern way and also to practice some of the functions that i have learen during the courses that i took.



HOW DOES IT WORK?
The main page, which shows the preyer times, is using an api system to get the data from and then decode it and displaing it in a fancy way. The second page is just getting the data from a built-in dectionary.



WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?
Okay, let me show you the UI of it in some screenshots:
